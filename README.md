# GPUParallelSpatialAdaptiveKDE
The C/C++ implementation of GPU-Parallel and OpenMP-parallel Spatially Adaptive Kernel Density Estimation for Point Pattern Analysis. The OpenMP version is in the 'kde_openmp' directory and the CUDA GPU version in the 'kde_cuda' directory. Find more detail about the code in this paper: xxxxx.

# Environment
Ubuntu OS, with CUDA installed to run the CUDA version.
